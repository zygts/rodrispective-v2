        <p>Few people know about this, but I’ve been making music for as long as I can remember. Under different names, in collaboration but mostly solo, in the darkness of my bedroom. Always unreleased.</p>
        <p>I designed and developed this website as a tribute to myself. A retrospective of my work, the music of Rodrigo Núñez, in all its shapes, forms and monikers. A retrospective in all its disappointment and unsung glory: A Rodrispective.</p>
